          blockquote: p.
            Wobbegong is the common name given to the 12 species of carpet sharks in the family Orectolobidae. They are
            found in shallow temperate and tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean,
            chiefly around Australia and Indonesia, although one species [...] occurs as far north as Japan. The word
            wobbegong is believed to come from an Australian Aboriginal language, meaning "shaggy beard".
